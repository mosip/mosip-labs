# Agents by role

One orchestrator ([`orchestrator.md`](../agents/orchestrator.md)) owns state, approvals and evidence; every other agent is a
specialist grouped by the role it plays in a team. Folders are for people; the workflow and the installer find agents
by their `name:` (installed as `crewline-<name>`), so moving a file between role folders changes nothing at runtime.
Product facts (TestRig, MOSIP map, stack tools) come from the active pack (`python -m crewline pack`), not from `core/`.

## Role folders

- `product/` - **Product Owner / Business Analyst**: what to build and how we know it is done
- `ui-ux/` - **UI / UX**: how users experience it: screens, states, copy, accessibility
- `architecture/` - **Architect**: how it fits: impact, design options, contracts
- `development/` - **Developer**: building it: code, unit/component tests, data changes
- `qa/` - **QA / SDET**: proving it works: test design, automation, failure analysis, defects
- `review/` - **Reviewer**: independent checks of the change
- `security/` - **Security**: threats, auth, secrets, dependencies
- `devops/` - **DevOps / Release**: pipelines, deploys, release readiness
- `operations/` - **SRE / Operations**: running systems: incidents, post-deployment checks
- `knowledge/` - **Knowledge**: what the team learns: verified knowledge, module onboarding

Adding an agent: put the contract in its role folder, add it to `core/permissions.yaml` `agents:`, mention it in the
orchestrator's delegation step if it owns a state, and run the validator tests.
